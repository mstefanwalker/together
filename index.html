        <h2>The Workshop</h2>

        <p>I attended a workshop lead by Emily Provance at NEYM Sessions similar to <a href="https://www.pym.org/event/election-violence-prevention-with-emily-provance/">this one</a> from Philadelphia Yearly Meeting on election violence prevention.</p>

        <p>From the workshop description:</p>

        <blockquote>
            Most people don’t want violence in our 2024 election cycle, but many believe the “other side” does. The team for nonviolence is much bigger than we think. We just need to expand the definition of “we.”
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            Politics are important, but peace is non-partisan, so this conversation is not a political one.
        </blockquote>

        <p>Leaving the workshop, a simple connection stood out to me; a people who do not trust their government are more likely to use violence in times of contention.</p>

        <h2>Trustworthy Elections</h2>

        <p>Braver Angels has conducted 26 workshops in the past 3 years, each with a balanced number of politically Red and Blue participants. The purpose: to find ways to build confidence in our elections. The 194 participants agreed on 727 values, concerns, and solutions, <em>with every word agreed upon unanimously.</em></p>

        <p>The result of these workshops is compiled in the <a href="https://braverangels.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/BA_2024-Trustworthy-Elections-Report-V12-WEB.pdf">Trustworthy Elections Report</a> which describes 23 specific solutions. The report focuses on these principles:</p>

        <blockquote>
            “Voting should be easy. Cheating should be hard.”
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            “Every citizen should have an equal say in who will govern them; this is done through free and fair elections.”
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            “The American government will fail if candidates refuse to accept any outcome other than victory.”
        </blockquote>

        <p>If you are interested in how these principles are captured in concrete solutions, the report is definitely worth the read.</p>

        <h2>The Hope</h2>

        <p>Hearing this unifying message has me hopeful.</p>
        
        <p>If you have my personal contact, feel free to reach out and maybe we can talk over food. I'm thinking of trying to find actions in line with the Trustworthy Elections Report and election violence prevention.</p>

        <p>If you don't, feel free to share this site with someone else you know and start a conversation!</p>
